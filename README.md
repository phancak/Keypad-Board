# STM32L010K4T6 Keypad Board  

## Overview  
This project features a **low-power, compact keypad module** based on the **STM32L010K4T6 MCU**, designed to function as a **mini keyboard** for embedded systems. The board includes **twelve tactile buttons**, with the STM32 MCU handling **debouncing and key scanning**, then transmitting keypress data to a host MCU via **I2C or UART**.  

This design optimizes processing efficiency on the host system by **offloading keypad management to the STM32L010K4T6**, making it ideal for applications requiring reliable **user input with minimal power consumption**.  

## Features  
âœ… **STM32L010K4T6 MCU** â€“ Ultra-low-power ARM Cortex-M0+ processor  
âœ… **12-Button Keypad** â€“ Efficient, responsive user input  
âœ… **I2C & UART Communication** â€“ Flexible interfacing with host MCUs  
âœ… **Debouncing & Key Scanning** â€“ Handled in firmware for accurate input detection
